		<h3> <em>// <strong>angel .</strong></em> </h3>
		<br></br>
		<div>
			.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.
			<p> A new young angel carried by her wings descended from the sky to the green bank, there where I passed, alone, to my destiny, When she saw I was without companion, or guard, she stretched a noose, woven of silk, in the grass, with which the way was turfed. </p>
			.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.
			<p> Then I was captured: and later it did not displease me, so sweet a light issued from her eyes. </p>
		</div>

		<div> 
			<p> She let her gold hair scatter in the breeze that twined it in a thousand sweet knots, and wavering light, beyond measure, would burn in those beautiful eyes, which are now so dim: and it seemed to me her face wore the colour of pity, I do not know whether false or true: </p> 

			<p> I who had the lure of love in my breast, what wonder if I suddenly caught fire? Her way of moving was no mortal thing, but of angelic form: and her speech rang higher than a mere human voice. </p> 

			<p> A celestial spirit, <em> a living sun </em> was what I saw: and if she is not such now,the wound's not healed, although the bow is slack. </p> 
		</div>

		<div> 
			<p> From what part of the heavens, from what idea came the example, from which Nature took that beautiful joyful face, in which she chose to show down here what power she has above? What nymph of the fountain, what goddess of the wood loosed hair of such fine gold on the breeze? </p> 

			<h5> <strong> <em>How did a heart gather so much virtue to itself, though the sum of it is guilty of my death?</em> </strong> </h5> 
		.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.
			<p> He looks in vain for divine beauty who has never yet seen how tenderly she moves those eyes of hers around: he does not know how Love heals, and how he kills, who does not know how sweet her sighs are, and how sweet her speech, and sweet her smile.</p>  
		</div>
		.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.
		<div> 
			<p> Zephyr returns and brings fair weather,and the flowers and herbs, his sweet family, and Procne singing and Philomela weeping, and the white springtime, and the vermilion.The meadows smile, and the skies grow clear: </p> 

			<p> Jupiter is joyful gazing at his daughter: the air and earth and water are filled with love: every animal is reconciled to loving. </p>

			<p> But to me, alas, there return the heaviest sighs, that she draws from the deepest heart, who took the keys of it away to heaven: and the song of little birds, and the flowering fields, and the sweet, virtuous actions of women are a wasteland to me, <strong> of bitter and savage creatures. </strong> </p>
