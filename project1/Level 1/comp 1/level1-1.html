	<p>A new young angel carried by her wings</p>

	<p>descended</p> 
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp from
	<br></br> 
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the sky
	to the green bank,

	there where I passed  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp alone  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp to my destiny,
	<br></br>
	When she saw I was without companion,
	<br></br>
	or guard, 
	<br></br>
	she stretched a noose, woven of silk,

	in the grass, with which the way was turfed.
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThen I was captured: and later it did not displease me,

	so sweet a light issued from her eyes.

	<p>She let her gold hair&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp s&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspc&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspa&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspt&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspt&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspe&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspr&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp in the breeze

	that twined it in a thousand sweet knots,
	<br></br>
	and wavering light, beyond measure, would burn

	in those beautiful eyes, which are now so dim:</p>
	<br></br>
	and it seemed to me her face wore the colour

	of pity, I do not know whether false or true:
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	I who had the lure of love in my breast,

	what wonder if I &nbsp &nbsp &nbspsuddenly&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp caught fire?
	<br></br>
	Her way of moving 
	<br></br>
	<p>was no mortal thing,but of angelic form:</p> 
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	and her speech
	<br></br>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp higher
	<br></br>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp rang &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp than a mere human voice.
	<br></br>
	A celestial spirit, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp a living sun
	<br></br>
	was what I saw: and if she is not such now,
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp the wound's not healed, although the bow is slack
	<br></br>
	. 
	<br></br>
	<br></br> 
	FromÂ what part of the heavens, from what idea

	came the example, from which Nature took
	<br></br>
	&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp that beautiful joyful face, 
	<br></br>
	in which she chose
	<br></br>
	&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbspto show down here what power she has above?
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	What nymph of the fountain, what goddess of the wood &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp

	loosed hair of such fine gold on the breeze?
	<br></br>
	How did a heart gather so much virtue to itself,
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp
	though the sum of it is guilty of my death?
	<br></br>
	He looks in vain for divine beauty

	who has never yet seen how tenderly

	she moves those eyes of hers around:

	he does not know how Love heals, and how he 
	<br></br>
	and how he&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp k&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp i&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp l&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp l&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp s&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp,
	<br></br>
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp who does not know how sweet her sighs are,

	and how sweet her speech, and sweet her smile.
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	<p>Zephyr returns and brings fair weather,

	and the flowers and herbs, his sweet family,

	and Procne singing and Philomela weeping,

	and the white springtime, and the vermilion.</p>

	The meadows smile, and the skies grow clear:

	Jupiter is joyful gazing at his daughter:

	the air and earth and water are filled with love:

	every animal is reconciled to loving.</p>
	<br></br>
	But to me, alas, there return the heaviest

	sighs, that she draws from the deepest heart,

	who took the keys of it away to heaven:

	and the song of little birds, and the flowering fields,
	<br></br>
	and the sweet, virtuous actions of women
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp are a wasteland to me, of bitter and savage creatures.
