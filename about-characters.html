                    <h2>Gia</h2>
                    <p>Gia, much like the rest of the world, never knew anything beyond her own village. Even then, all she really knew were the stories - myths of the past and how they came to be, though none of them ever felt quite right. There always seemed to be missing details and gaps in the timeline. And so Gia, and her people, resigned themselves to wonder. That is, until she met Cleo, a wind spirit who was attracted by the melodies of her pan flute. On a return visit, when Cleo brings Gia an ancient mechanism that's still functional, the truth appears to finally be in sight. But will the truth be more than she's willing to bargain for?</p>

                    <h2>Cleo</h2>
                    <p>Cleo is a breath of fresh air - quite literally. A traveling elemental drawn to potential, he senses a kindred spirit in Gia and decides to let her in on an age-old secret, closely guarded by the Mother for centuries. An idealist, he believes that humanity should know their past in order to claim their future, to triumph over their supposed 'nature.' But humans and Nature may be more stubborn than he gave them credit for.</p>

                    <h2>Imogen</h2>
                    <p>Imogen grew up on the fringes of civilization, and saw firsthand how harsh Mother Nature could be. Now, she lives in the world's first independently run city, founded by her father on the principle of "every man for himself;" a system under which Imogen and her family prosper. In her spare time, she collects scrap from the nearby landfills and rebuilds ancient mechanisms, but has never been able to get one to work. At least, until she finds a strange village girl at the landfill operating one. Could the girl lead Imogen to a power source? Or will she instead lead her into a power struggle? </p>
