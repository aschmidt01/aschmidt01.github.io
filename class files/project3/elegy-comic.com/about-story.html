            <p> A story of nature vs. nurture - literally.</p>

            <p> In a world not so different from our own, Mother Nature has revolted against humanity for their negligence in caring for the planet. Since then, mankind has been forced to relearn how to live of the land, while separated from their memory of their previous civilization.</p>

            <p> As they say, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. So when an opportunity arises to confront the sins of the past, humanity must decide if they can truly change . . . or if self-destruction is just in their nature.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>The earliest version of <em>Elegy</em> was born in 2015; the story was radically different and hinged more on the relationship between the characters that would eventually become Cleo and Gia. Since then, it's undergone plenty of revision and is still considered a work in progress, with the artist still open to rewrites in future (Nothing is ever really done until we're dead, kids).</p>

            <p> As of right now, there are two completed chapters (1 full volume) of <em>Elegy</em>, and a third chapter on the way. Looking for story updates and other information? Visit the <a href="latest-news.html">Latest News</a> page for details.</p>
