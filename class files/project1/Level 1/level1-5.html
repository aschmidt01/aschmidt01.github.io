	<p>A new young angel carried by &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~wings

	descended from the sky to the green bank,

	there where I passed, alone, to my  destiny,

	When &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ she &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ saw I was without companion,

	or guard, &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ she &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ stretched a noose, woven of silk,

	in the grass, with which the way was turfed.

	Then I was captured: and later it did not displease me,

	so sweet a light issued from &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ eyes.</p>

	<p>&nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ She &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ let &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ gold hair scatter in the breeze

	that twined it in a thousand sweet knots,

	and wavering light, beyond measure, would burn

	in those beautiful eyes, which are now so dim:

	and it seemed to me ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ face wore the colour

	of pity, I do not know whether false or true:

	I who had the lure of love in my breast,

	what wonder if I suddenly caught fire?

	&nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ Her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ way of moving was no mortal thing,

	but of angelic form: and &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ speech

	rang higher than a mere human voice.

	A celestial spirit, a living sun

	was what I saw: and if &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ she &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ is not such now,

	the wound's not healed, although the bow is slack.</p>

	<p>From what part of the heavens, from what idea

	came the example, from which Nature took

	that beautiful joyful face, in which &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ she &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ chose

	to show down here what power she has above?

	What nymph of the fountain, what goddess of the wood

	loosed hair of such fine gold on the breeze?

	How did a heart gather so much virtue to itself,

	though the sum of it is guilty of my death?

	He looks in vain for divine beauty

	who has never yet seen how tenderly

	she moves those eyes of &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ hers &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ around:

	he does not know how Love heals, and how he kills,

	who does not know how sweet &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ sighs are,

	and how sweet &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ speech, and sweet &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ her &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ smile.</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>Zephyr returns and brings fair weather,

	and the flowers and herbs, his sweet family,

	and Procne singing and Philomela weeping,

	and the white springtime, and the vermilion.</p>

	<p>The meadows smile, and the skies grow clear:

	Jupiter is joyful gazing at his daughter:

	the air and earth and water are filled with love:

	every animal is reconciled to loving.</p>
	<br></br>
	But to me, alas, there return the heaviest

	sighs, that &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ she &nbsp ~ &nbsp * &nbsp ~ draws from the deepest heart,

	who took the keys of it away to heaven:

	and the song of little birds, and the flowering fields,
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	and the sweet, virtuous actions of women

	are a wasteland to me, 
	<br></br>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp of bitter and savage creatures.
