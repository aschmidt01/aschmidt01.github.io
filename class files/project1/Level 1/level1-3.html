	<p>A new young &nbsp a &nbsp n &nbsp g &nbsp e &nbsp l &nbsp carried by her &nbsp w &nbsp i &nbsp n &nbsp g &nbsp s &nbsp descended from the &nbsp s &nbsp k &nbsp y &nbsp to the green bank, there where I passed, alone, to my destiny, When she saw I was without companion, or guard, she stretched a noose, woven of silk, in the grass, with which the way was turfed. </p> 
	<p>Then I was captured: and later it did not displease me, so sweet a light issued from her eyes. </p>
	<p> She let her gold hair scatter in the breeze that twined it in a thousand sweet knots, and wavering light, beyond measure, would burn in those beautiful eyes, which are now so dim: and it seemed to me her face wore the colour of pity, I do not know whether false or true: I who had the lure of love in my breast, what wonder if I suddenly caught fire? </p>
	<p>Her way of moving was no mortal thing, but of &nbsp a &nbsp n &nbsp g &nbsp e &nbsp l &nbsp i &nbsp c &nbsp form: and her speech rang higher than a mere human voice.</p>
	<p>A &nbsp c &nbsp e &nbsp l &nbsp e &nbsp s &nbsp t &nbsp i &nbsp a &nbsp l &nbsp s &nbsp p &nbsp i&nbsp r &nbsp i &nbsp t &nbsp, a living &nbsp s &nbsp u &nbsp n &nbsp was what I saw: and if she is not such now, the wound's not healed, although the bow is slack. </p>
	<p>From what part of the &nbsp h &nbsp e &nbsp a &nbsp v &nbsp e &nbsp n &nbsp s &nbsp, from what idea came the example, from which Nature took that beautiful joyful face, in which she chose to show down here what power she has above? </p>
	<p>What &nbsp n &nbsp y &nbsp m &nbsp p &nbsp h &nbsp of the fountain, what &nbsp g &nbsp o &nbsp d &nbsp d &nbsp e &nbsp s &nbsp s &nbsp of the wood loosed hair of such fine gold on the &nbsp b &nbsp r &nbsp e &nbsp e &nbsp z &nbsp e &nbsp? </p>
	<p>How did a heart gather so much virtue to itself, though the sum of it is guilty of my death? </p>
	<p>He looks in vain for &nbsp d &nbsp i &nbsp v &nbsp i &nbsp n &nbsp e &nbsp beauty who has never yet seen how tenderly she moves those eyes of hers around: he does not know how Love heals, and how he kills, who does not know how sweet her sighs are, and how sweet her speech, and sweet her smile.</p>
	<p>&nbsp Z &nbsp e &nbsp p &nbsp h &nbsp y &nbsp r &nbsp returns and brings fair weather, and the flowers and herbs, his sweet family, and Procne singing and Philomela weeping, and the white springtime, and the vermilion.</p>
	<p>The meadows smile, and the &nbsp s &nbsp k &nbsp i &nbsp e &nbsp s &nbsp grow clear: Jupiter is joyful gazing at his daughter: the &nbsp a &nbsp i &nbsp r and earth and water are filled with love: every animal is reconciled to loving.</p>
	<p>But to me,alas, there return the heaviest sighs, that she draws from the deepest heart, who took the keys of it away to &nbsp h &nbsp e &nbsp a &nbsp v &nbsp e &nbsp n &nbsp:   and the song of &nbsp l &nbsp i &nbsp t &nbsp t &nbsp l &nbsp e &nbsp b &nbsp i &nbsp r &nbsp d &nbsp s &nbsp, and the flowering fields, and the sweet, virtuous actions of women are a wasteland to me, of bitter and savage creatures.</p>
