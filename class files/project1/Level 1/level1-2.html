	<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A &nbsp new &nbsp young angel carried by her wings

	descended from the sky to the green bank,

	there where I passed, &nbsp &nbsp alone, &nbsp &nbsp to my destiny,

	When she saw I was without companion,

	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp or guard, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp she stretched a noose, woven of silk,

	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp in the grass, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp with which the way was turfed.</p>

	<p>Then I was captured: and later it did not displease me,

	so sweet a light issued from her eyes.

	She let her gold hair &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp scatter &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp in the breeze

	that twined it in a thousand sweet knots,

	and wavering light,&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp beyond measure,&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp would burn

	in those beautiful eyes, which are now so dim:

	and it seemed to me her face wore the colour

	of pity, I do not know whether false or true:

	I &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp who had the lure of love in my breast,&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

	what wonder if I suddenly caught fire? </p>

	<p>Her way of moving was no mortal thing,

	but of angelic form: and her speech

	rang higher than a mere human voice.

	A celestial spirit, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a living sun &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

	was what I saw: and if she is not such now,

	the wound's not healed, although the bow is slack.</p>

	<p>From what part of the heavens, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp from what idea &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

	came the example, from which Nature took

	that beautiful joyful face, in which she chose

	to show down here what power she has above?</p>

	<p>What nymph of the fountain, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp what goddess of the wood &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

	loosed hair of such fine gold on the breeze?

	How did a heart gather so much virtue to itself,

	though the sum of it is guilty of my death?</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>He looks in vain for divine beauty

	who has never yet seen how tenderly

	she moves those eyes of hers around:

	he does not know how Love heals, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and how he kills,&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

	who does not know how sweet her sighs are,

	and how sweet her speech, and sweet her smile.</p>

	<p>Zephyr returns and brings fair weather,

	and the flowers and herbs, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp his sweet family,&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

	and Procne singing and Philomela weeping,

	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and the white springtime, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and the vermilion.

	The meadows smile, and the skies grow clear:

	Jupiter is joyful gazing at his daughter:

	the air and earth and water are filled with love:

	every animal is reconciled to loving. </p>

	But to me, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp alas, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp there return the heaviest

	sighs, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp that she draws from the deepest heart, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 

	who took the keys of it away to heaven:

	and the song of little birds, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and the flowering fields, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

	and the sweet, virtuous actions of women

	are a wasteland to me, of bitter and savage creatures.
